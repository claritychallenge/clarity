--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are organising a series of machine learning challenges to enhance hearing-aid signal processing and to better predict
how people perceive speech-in-noise (Clarity) and speech-in-music (Cadenza). For further details of the Clarity Project
visit [the Clarity project website](http://claritychallenge.org/), and for details of our latest Clarity challenges
visit our [challenge documentation site](https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity_CC_doc/). You can contact the
Clarity Team by email at [claritychallengecontact@gmail.com](claritychallengecontact@gmail.com). For further details of
the Cadenza Project visit [the Cadenza project website](http://cadenzachallenge.org/), and to find out about the latest
Cadenza challenges join the [Cadenza Challenge Group](https://groups.google.com/g/cadenza-challenge).

In this repository, you will find code to support all Clarity and Cadenza Challenges, including baselines, toolkits, and
systems from participants. **We encourage you to make your system/model open source and contribute to this repository.**

## Current Events.

- The 1st Cadenza Challenge (CAD1) - Open Now [visit the website](http://cadenzachallenge.org/docs/cadenza1/cc1_intro) for details on how to take part :fire::fire::fire:
- The 2nd Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2) Online Workshop - December 12th - [Register Now!](https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2022-CEC2-workshop/):fire::fire::fire:
- The ICASSP 2023 Clarity Challenge - Open Now [visit the website](https://claritychallenge.org/ICASSP2023_announcement_page/) for details on how to take part. Closing Feb 8th.

## Installation

### PyPI

Clarity is available on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pyclarity) to install create and/or
activate a virtual environment and then use `pip` to install.

``` bash
conda create --name clarity python=3.8
conda activate clarity

pip install pyclarity
```

### GitHub Cloning

```bash
# First clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity.git
cd clarity

# Second create & activate environment with conda, see https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
conda create --name clarity python=3.8
conda activate clarity

# Last install with pip
pip install -e .
```

### GitHub pip install

Alternatively `pip` allows you to install packages from GitHub sources directly. The following will install the current
`main` branch.

``` bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity.git@main
```

## Challenges

Current challenge(s)

- [The 1st Cadenza Challenge (CAD1)](./recipes/cad1)
- [The ICASSP 2023 Enhancement Challenge](./recipes/icassp_2023)

Upcoming challenges

- The 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge is due to launch in February 2023.

Previous challenges

- [The 1st Clarity Prediction Challenge (CPC1)](./recipes/cpc1)
- [The 1st Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC1)](./recipes/cec1)

## Available tools

We provide also a number of tools in this repository:

- **Hearing loss simulation**
  - [Cambridge MSBG hearing loss simulator](./clarity/evaluator/msbg): descriptions can be found in the [CEC1
      description](./recipes/cec1); an usage example can be found in the [CEC1 baseline](./recipes/cec1/baseline)
      evaluation script `evaluate.py`.
- **Objective intelligibility measurement**
  - [Modified binaural STOI (MBSTOI)](./clarity/evaluator/mbstoi/mbstoi.py): a Python implementation of MBSTOI. It is
      jointly used with the MSBG hearing loss model in the [CEC1 baseline](./recipes/cec1/baseline). The official matlab
      implementation can be found here: <http://ah-andersen.net/code/>
  - [Hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI)](./clarity/evaluator/haspi/haspi.py): a Python implementation of
      HASPI Version 2, and the better-ear HASPI for binaural speech signals. For official matlab implementation, request here: <https://www.colorado.edu/lab/hearlab/resources>
  - [Hearing-aid speech quality index (HASQI)](./clarity/evaluator/hasqi/hasqi.py): a Python implementation of
      HASQI Version 2, and the better-ear HASQI for binaural speech signals.
  - [Hearing-aid audio quality index (HAAQI)](./clarity/evaluator/haaqi/haaqi.py): a Python implementation of
      HAAQI.
- **Hearing aid enhancement**
  - [Cambridge hearing aid fitting (CAMFIT)](./clarity/enhancer/gha/gainrule_camfit.py): a Python implementation of CAMFIT, translated from the [HÃ¶rTech Open Master Hearing Aid (OpenMHA)](http://www.openmha.org/about/); the CAMFIT is used together with OpenMHA enhancement as the [CEC1 baseline](./recipes/cec1/baseline), see `enhance.py`.
  - [NAL-R hearing aid fitting](./clarity/enhancer/nalr.py): a Python implementation of NAL-R prescription fitting. It is used as the [CEC2 baseline](./recipes/cec2/baseline), see `enhance.py`.

In addition, differentiable approximation to some tools are provided:

- [x] [Differentiable MSBG hearing loss model](./clarity/predictor/torch_msbg.py). See also the BUT implementation:
      <https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/torch_msbg_mbstoi>
- [ ] Differentiable HASPI (coming)

## Open-source systems

- CPC1:
  - [Exploiting Hidden Representations from a DNN-based Speech Recogniser for Speech Intelligibility Prediction in
    Hearing-impaired Listeners](./recipes/cpc1/e032_sheffield)
  - [Unsupervised Uncertainty Measures of Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-intrusive Speech Intelligibility
    Prediction](./recipes/cpc1/e029_sheffield)
- CEC1:
  - [A Two-Stage End-to-End System for Speech-in-Noise Hearing Aid Processing](./recipes/cec1/e009_sheffield)
