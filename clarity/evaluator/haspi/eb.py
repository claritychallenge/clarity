    """
    Function that implements a cochlear model that includes the middle ear,
    auditory filter bank, Outer Hair Cell (OHC) dynamic-range compression,
    and Inner Hair Cell (IHC) attenuation.

    The inputs are the reference and processed signals that are to be
    compared. The reference is at the reference intensity (e.g. 65 dB SPL
    or with NAL-R amplification) and has no other processing. The processed
    signal is the hearing-aid output, and is assumed to have the same or
    greater group delay compared to the reference.

    The function outputs the envelopes of the signals after OHC compression
    and IHC loss attenuation.

    Arguments:
        reference (np.ndarray): reference signal: should be adjusted to 65 dB SPL
            (itype=0 or 1) or to 65 dB SPL plus NAL-R gain (itype=2)
        reference_freq (int): sampling rate for the reference signal, Hz
        processed (np.ndarray): processed signal (e.g. hearing-aid output) includes
            HA gain
        processed_freq (int): sampling rate for the processed signal, Hz
        hearing_loss (np.ndarray): audiogram giving the hearing loss in dB at 6
            audiometric frequencies: [250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000] Hz
        itype (int): purpose for the calculation:
             0=intelligibility: reference is normal hearing and must not
               include NAL-R EQ
             1=quality: reference does not include NAL-R EQ
             2=quality: reference already has NAL-R EQ applied
        level1:   level calibration: signal RMS=1 corresponds to Level1 dB SPL
        nchan (int): auditory frequency bands
        m_delay (int): Compensate for the gammatone group delay.
        shift (float): Basal shift of the basilar membrane length

    Returns:
        reference_db (): envelope for the reference in each band
        reference_basilar_membrane (): BM motion for the reference in each band
        processed_db (): envelope for the processed signal in each band
        processed_basilar_membrane (): BM motion for the processed signal in each band
        reference_sl (): compressed RMS average reference in each band converted
            to dB SL
        processed_sl (): compressed RMS average output in each band converted to dB SL
        freq_sample (): sampling rate in Hz for the model outputs

    Updates:
    James M. Kates, 27 October 2011.
    Basilar Membrane added 30 Dec 2011.
    Revised 19 June 2012.
    Remove match of reference RMS level to processed 29 August 2012.
