# CLARITY CEC1 Data Preparation

The code here explains how we generated the CEC1 scenes. Please note that 6000 training scenes and 2500 development scenes are included in the data you downloaded. If you are intereted in how we generated the scenes, you could run the scripts to get the idea.

In `data_config.yaml`, specify `root` folder in which you unpack the data. Run `prepare_cec1_data.py` to generate the train & dev scenes.
